      "description": "Chicken Kabab is a popular grilled or fried dish made from marinated chicken, typically mixed with spices, yogurt, and herbs. It is often skewered and cooked over charcoal, giving it a smoky flavor. Variations include Tandoori Kabab, Seekh Kabab, and Malai Kabab, each with unique spices and textures.",
      "procedure": "To prepare delicious chicken kababs, start by cutting boneless chicken into small cubes. In a mixing bowl, combine thick yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, lemon juice, gram flour, red chili powder, garam masala, turmeric, cumin powder, coriander powder, kasuri methi, salt, and oil. Add the chicken pieces to this mixture and coat them well, ensuring all the flavors are absorbed. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 2-3 hours or overnight for better taste. If using wooden skewers, soak them in water for 30 minutes to prevent burning. Once the chicken is well-marinated, thread the pieces onto the skewers. Preheat the oven to 200°C (400°F) and place the skewers on a baking tray. Cook for 15-20 minutes, turning occasionally and basting with butter for added moisture. Alternatively, grill the kababs for 10-12 minutes or pan-fry them in a little oil for 8-10 minutes until they are golden brown and fully cooked. Once done, remove the kababs from the skewers and serve hot with mint chutney, onion rings, and lemon wedges for a flavorful meal.",
